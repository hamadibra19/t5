        "In this step, you will design and build a NLP Classifier model to classify text data. Below is a breakdown of the key components you'll implement, but it's up to you to decide how to configure them based on your understanding and experimentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Type**:\n",
        "   You will use a Sequential model, which allows you to stack layers in a linear sequence.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. **Embedding Layer**:\n",
